## Chirper

Chirper is a work-in-progress minimal twitter clone.

It's my first project with laravel and php, which is why I am loosly following the [Official Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com) although I plan to add a few unique features once I get more comfortable with this stack.

[routes/web.php](https://github.com/spcbfr/chirper/blob/main/routes/web.php) is a good entry point to the project if you want to go through it and I feel like it's clean enough that non-php developers will be able to read it with ease.

## Learning by doing

As I work on this project I take notes on new concepts and interesting code snippets that I might find useful later on. I use a free program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for this.
